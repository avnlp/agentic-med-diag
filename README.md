This repository implements an Agentic GraphRAG system for Medical Diagnosis. It ingests medical literature, extracts structured clinical knowledge into a Neo4j knowledge graph with hierarchical communities, and answers diagnostic questions through multi-strategy retrieval and an agentic plan–research–verify reasoning loop.

</p>

- **Schema-driven knowledge graph** built from a runtime-injectable schema of medical entity and relation types that drives every extractor, resolver, summarizer, and prompt.
- **Three-extractor fusion** combining GLiNER NER, GLiREL relation extraction, and LLM extraction, merged with configurable union, intersection, max-score, or GLiNER-primary strategies.
- **Two-stage entity resolution** using a deterministic SemHash/MinHash pre-filter followed by clustering, BM25 + cosine candidate retrieval, and LLM deduplication.
- **Hierarchical community detection** using the Leiden algorithm (Graspologic or Neo4j GDS), with LLM-generated community reports summarising each cluster.
- **Four vector collections** (entity, relation, chunk, community) for complementary semantic search.
- **Layered retrieval** combining atomic search methods, pluggable rerankers, and data-only recipes, fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion or a cross-encoder.
- **Agentic plan–research–verify loop** that decomposes the question, runs parallel researchers over retrieval tools, and gates synthesis on a deterministic sufficiency check.
- **Pluggable storage** with Neo4j for the graph and Qdrant or Weaviate for vectors.

The system is built using:  

- [**GLiNER**](https://github.com/urchade/GLiNER) and [**GLiREL**](https://github.com/jackboyla/GLiREL) for local zero-shot entity and relation extraction.  
- [**Graspologic**](https://github.com/microsoft/graspologic) / [**Neo4j GDS**](https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science) for Hierarchical Leiden community detection.  
- [**Neo4j**](https://neo4j.com/) for the persistent knowledge graph with typed nodes, edges, and hierarchical communities.  
- [**Qdrant**](https://qdrant.io/) / [**Weaviate**](https://weaviate.io/) for vector search and hybrid (dense + BM25) retrieval.  
- [**BAML**](https://www.boundaryml.com/) for type-safe, schema-injected LLM functions.  
- [**LangGraph**](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph) for orchestrating the extraction, embedding, and search pipelines.  
- [**DeepAgents**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) for the multi-agent reasoning loop.  
- [**ZeroEntropy**](https://www.zeroentropy.dev) for embeddings and reranking.  

## Knowledge Graph

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/graph_schema.png" alt="Knowledge Graph Schema" width="900">
</p>

The system stores everything in a single typed property graph in Neo4j with five node labels (`Document`, `Chunk`, `Entity`, `Community`, `CommunityReport`) and seven edge types:

```
(:Document) <-[:PART_OF]-  (:Chunk) -[:HAS_ENTITY]-> (:Entity:<Type>)
(:Chunk)    -[:NEXT_CHUNK]-> (:Chunk)
(:Entity)   -[:RELATES_TO {type, description, score}]-> (:Entity)
(:Entity)   -[:IN_COMMUNITY]->     (:Community)
(:Community)-[:PARENT_COMMUNITY]-> (:Community)
(:Community)-[:HAS_REPORT]->       (:CommunityReport)
```

### Entities

- An entity carries its `name`, medical `label` (Disease, Drug, …), an optional `description`, an extraction `score`, and free-form `schema_properties`. Its identity is `(name, label)`.
- Resolution later fills in a `canonical_name` and a list of `aliases` (for example, *metformin → metformin HCl, Glucophage*).
- A `provenance` record tracks which extractors produced the entity, the surface forms seen in the text, and the source chunk ids and offsets.

### Relations

- A relation is a directed subject–predicate–object triple (`head → type → tail`) with a `description`, `score`, and properties.
- Before resolution, endpoints are known only by name; resolution links them to canonical entity ids.
- The schema constrains each relation's valid head and tail types - `TREATED_BY` only connects `Disease → {Drug, DrugClass, Procedure}` - which the extractor uses to reject implausible triples.
- All relations persist as generic `:RELATES_TO` edges with the medical type in the `type` property.

### Communities

- After resolution, hierarchical Leiden partitions the resolved relation graph into nested communities. Each `Community` records its level, its parent community, and the entities and relations it contains.
- An LLM generates a `CommunityReport` for each community, bottom-up by level: a title, a summary, structured findings, and a clinical-importance rating. Lower-level reports roll up into higher-level ones.
- Community reports give the agent a thematic, cluster-level view, so a broad question can be answered from a single summary instead of many low-level facts.

### Schema

The schema is a first-class runtime value. It is injected into every extractor, resolver, summarizer, and prompt, and into BAML as dynamic enum types, so the LLM is constrained to the schema rather than merely prompted with it. Each type carries natural-language hints used to steer GLiNER and GLiREL, descriptions used in LLM prompts, and (for relations) the allowed head and tail label sets.

The default schema defines 13 entity types:

1. `Disease`
2. `Drug`
3. `DrugClass`
4. `Symptom`
5. `Pathogen`
6. `AnatomicalStructure`
7. `Procedure`
8. `DiagnosticTest`
9. `RiskFactor`
10. `Gene`
11. `Protein`
12. `Pathway`
13. `MechanismOfAction`

and 25 relation types, grouped by clinical role:

| Group | Relations |
|-------|-----------|
| **Clinical** (disease-centered) | `HAS_SYMPTOM`, `TREATED_BY`, `DIAGNOSED_BY`, `CAUSED_BY`, `HAS_GENETIC_CAUSE`, `AFFECTS`, `HAS_COMPLICATION`, `DIFFERENTIAL_FOR`, `HAS_RISK_FACTOR` |
| **Pharmacological** (drug-centered) | `BELONGS_TO_CLASS`, `TARGETS`, `INHIBITS`, `ACTIVATES`, `METABOLIZED_BY`, `INTERACTS_WITH`, `CONTRAINDICATED_IN`, `CAUSES_ADVERSE_EFFECT`, `MONITORED_BY`, `HAS_MECHANISM` |
| **Molecular** | `ENCODES`, `PARTICIPATES_IN` |
| **Structural** | `IS_A`, `PART_OF`, `INNERVATED_BY`, `SUPPLIED_BY` |

The schema is inspired by SNOMED CT relationship types, the UMLS semantic network, and clinical reasoning patterns.

## Architecture

The system has two data flows: ingestion (text into a knowledge graph and vector store) and retrieval using an agent.

## Ingestion Pipeline

Corpus ingestion streams documents, chunks them, and runs a LangGraph pipeline of graph construction components. State accumulates into a `KnowledgeGraph` that is written to Neo4j and the vector store. The stages run in order:

1. **Extract:** Each chunk is processed by up to three extractors that share the injected schema:
   - **GLiNER** runs batch zero-shot NER, steered by each entity type's natural-language label.
   - **GLiREL** runs zero-shot relation extraction over GLiNER's entity spans, so GLiREL requires GLiNER.
   - **LLM** runs a BAML extraction function with the valid entity and relation types injected as dynamic enums, constraining the model to the schema. Chunks are processed concurrently with bounded concurrency and isolated retries.
2. **Combine:** The three extractor outputs are merged per chunk using a configurable strategy: `union` (superset, merging provenance), `intersection` (only items every extractor found), `max_score` (highest-confidence version), or `gliner_primary` (GLiNER spans supplemented by the LLM).
3. **Normalize:** Within a chunk, entities are deduplicated by `(normalized name, label)` and relations by `(normalized head, normalized tail, type)`, merging sources, surface forms, chunk ids, scores, and properties. Low-confidence and too-short entities are filtered.
4. **Aggregate:** A deterministic, zero-LLM set-union across all chunks collapses the same keys into one cross-chunk candidate set.
5. **Resolve:** Entity and relation-type names are resolved in two stages: a deterministic deduplicator collapses exact and near-exact variants (SemHash, MinHash-LSH) and clusters the residual names; then, within each cluster, BM25 + cosine fusion retrieves candidates and an LLM selects exact duplicates and a single canonical alias. The result writes `canonical_name` and `aliases` onto entities and links relation endpoints to canonical entity ids.
6. **Detect communities:** Hierarchical Leiden runs over the resolved relation graph. Two interchangeable backends share one base class: graspologic-native (default) and Neo4j GDS. The output is a tree of communities with levels and parents.
7. **Summarize:** Communities are walked bottom-up by level; a degree-ranked, token-budgeted context is built for each and passed to an LLM that produces a titled report with structured findings and a clinical-importance rating.

Resolution runs before community detection so the graph is clustered over canonical entities.

## Embedding Pipeline

After graph construction, the embeddable fields of each model are vectorised and upserted into four vector collections.

Source | Text embedded |
--------|---------------|
Entity | canonical name |
Relation | three representations (below) |
Chunk | chunk text |
CommunityReport | report summary |

A single relation is embedded three ways, all keyed by the same relation id, because one vector cannot capture the predicate, the participants, and the full statement at once:

- **Edge fact** - the relation description (for example, *metformin treats type 2 diabetes*).
- **Edge type** - the predicate alone (for example, *TREATED_BY*).
- **Full SPO** - the subject–predicate–object sentence.

Collections support lazy creation, batch upsert, and native vector quantization.

## Retrieval Pipeline

Retrieval uses a layered design: types of search (Vector, Hybrid, Fulltext, BFS) compose into retrievers, which a Search Engine fans out over according to a recipe and fuses with a pluggable reranker.

- **Entity retriever** runs hybrid search over entity names, optionally expanding from the matched seed entities with bounded, degree-aware BFS.
- **Relation retriever** runs hybrid search over the relation collection, then hydrates full edges (head, tail, type, description) from the graph.
- **Chunk retriever** runs hybrid search over raw passages.
- **Community retriever** searches community report summaries for thematic answers.
- **Text-to-Cypher retriever** has an LLM translate the question into a read-only Cypher query against the schema, with few-shot examples and bounded retry.

Recipes are data-only constants that select which methods to run and how to fuse them, so a new strategy requires no orchestration change.

| Recipe | Methods | Reranker |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `entity` / `relation` / `chunk` / `community` | single method | RRF |
| `hybrid_rrf` | entity + relation + chunk + community | RRF |
| `hybrid_cross_encoder` | all four + BFS | cross-encoder |
| `bfs_expand` | entity + BFS | RRF |
| `text2cypher` | text-to-Cypher | RRF |

Results from the recipe's methods are gathered concurrently and fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion or a cross-encoder reranker. MMR and node-distance rerankers are also available. Fusion degrades gracefully, ignoring any method that returns no results.

## Agentic RAG Loop

The agent is a DeepAgents harness that coordinates three subagents with an orchestrator agent:

- **Planner** decomposes the clinical question into focused sub-questions, each mapped to a retrieval recipe. It has no tools and works from the question text.
- **Researcher** is spawned in parallel, one per sub-question. Each holds the retrieval tools (entity, relation, chunk, community, hybrid, text-to-Cypher search, and a community map-reduce tool) and returns evidence items with citations.
- **Verifier** reads the gathered evidence and returns a structured assessment - a coverage score, an evidence-depth score, missing pieces, targeted follow-ups, and unsupported claims. A deterministic numeric gate decides whether the evidence is sufficient.

When the gate fails, the targeted follow-ups seed another planning round, so the loop converges on missing information rather than repeating searches. When it passes (or iterations are exhausted), the orchestrator synthesises a structured answer with answer text, source citations, a confidence score, clinical caveats, and an answerability flag.

## Structured LLM Output (BAML)

Every LLM interaction outside the agent loop is a typed BAML function with explicit inputs, outputs, retry policy, and provider configuration.
